                    Valorant was made by a company named Riot Games. Which is very famous for the creation of League of Legends.<br>
                    After, only focusing on League of Legends for 11 years, Riot Games has decided to broaden their range and have<br>
                    introduced the game Valorant. At the beginning, it had recieved a lot of critisism for just being a copy of<br>
                    CSGO, which was another FPS shooter that was very loved in the FPS community. However, as time went by people<br>
                    began to see the differences, and, on the contrary, believe it was going to replace CSGO. As it recieved more<br> 
                    support and attention, they decided to create tournaments, which had a lot of viewers. Recieving money from<br>
                    League of Legends and Valorant, they have decided to also create a Netflix series based on League of Legends'<br>
                    lore. Which suprisingly got great ratings and scores. With hacing a successful year, Riot games have already<br>
                    introduced more games in which they are currently working on. Additionally, Riot games have also collabed with<br>
                    various musicians and groups, like Imagine Dragons. As it stands, Riot games currently has a large fanbase and<br>
                    support, unlike their competitors like Blizzard.
