                    Characters that people can choose from. Into total the roster has 18 agents. 100 is the defualt amount of<br> 
                    hitpoints an agent has, however players can also purchase shields: light shields(+25) and heavy shields +50.<br> 
                    Each agent possess their own abilities. Three main ones, and one that is an ultimate ability. Main ones can<br> 
                    be purchased, but to unlock the ultimate ability, you would need to get a certain amount of kills. Additionally<br> 
                    these abilites also define what kind of class the agent is in. Classes fall into four cateogries: Controllers,<br> 
                    Duelists, Initiators, and Sentinels. Controllers are agents that have abilities to control a field to set up<br> 
                    their team for success. This can come in forms such as deployable smokes. Duelists are agents that are supposed<br> 
                    to enter sites and be aggresive as possible, as they are expected to get eliminations. Agents that fit in this<br> 
                    class often have abilities like flashes and fast movemenets. Initiators are agents whose role is to enter contested<br> 
                    grounds by pushing away defender. This can be done in numorous ways, for example providing vision on enemies.<br> 
                    Lastly, Sentinels are agents who can hold down sites as well as defend them through their gadgets or abilities.<br> 
                    For example, a turret that would defend a site.

                    that explodes when it detects an enemy, however, the<br>

                    the enemy recieve double the damage from anything. Lastly,<br>
                    her ultimate skill is a device that can create a huge field<br>
                    that can cover a whole site. And if enemies are still in that<br>
                    field when the timer reaches zero, then they would become detained.<br>
                    Which basically, doesn't allow enemies to shoot nor move fast.
