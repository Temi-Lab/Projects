                <p>Valorant is a game that is made by riot games. The creator of also League of Legends.<br>
                Inside Valorant's home screen a user would see a navigation bar at the top of the screen, a vertical bar on the right<br>
                where they can add or join a friend's party. Lastly, a type of news source on the left that talks about the game's new updates.<br>
                At the navigation bar, users can expect a "Play button" in the middle, as well as, the buttons: career, collection and store on<br>
                the right side of it, and home, battlepass, agents on the left side. The home button would lead a person to the menu screen,<br>
                the battlepass would lead to rewards people can recieve if they would purchase it, the agents button would lead them to<br> 
                a gallery of playble characters, the career option would illustrate a user's statistics of their performance, as well as,<br> 
                their rank, the collection button would lead the user to a page that shows the weapons that users can use in-game. Lastly, the<br> 
                store button allows users to purchase cosmetics for their weapons. In addition, the purchasable cosmetics reset after a certain<br> 
                amount of time. This action renews the store, which presents people with different type of cosmetics. To add on, the last main<br>
                button is Play, which leads to a screen where they can join a game.

                <p>After pressing the Play button, people are able to choose different type of gamemodes, as well as, invite as many<br> 
                    as 4 teammates which fill the whole roster of five people. However, if a user decides to make a custom game then<br> 
                    they can invite as many as 9 people, since a full game consists of ten people, five on opposing sides. The most active <br>
                    gamemodes in Valorant are unrated and rank. In unrated people can play anyway they want without having their rank affected,<br>
                    however, in rank people play more competitively as the winner of game increases their rank. The ranks are iron, bronze, silver,<br> 
                    gold, platinum, diamond, immortal, and radiant. Iron being the lowest and radiant the highest. Your rank is decided by how much<br>
                    MMR (Matchmaking Rank) you have, and to increase MMR you have to win and perform well in rank games. Once you are in a game, you<br> 
                    go through agent picking phase, where you and your teammates choose what agents you want to play, however, two teammates cannot play<br>
                    the same agent. As a result it is good to decide on who you want to play before it gets to that phase. After that, you are dropped<br>
                    in a random map that has labeled sites. If you are on the defending side, then you are responsible for defending a site from attackers.<br>
                    As a defender you have three types of way to win. First way is to eliminate all attackers, second way is to prevent the attacking side<br>
                    from planting a bomb and wait until the timer runs out, and the third way is to eliminate all attackers after the bomb has been planted<br> 
                    and to then defuse it before it explodes. However, if you are an attacker, you are to decide on a site as a team and make a strategy to<br>
                    either eliminate all defenders or plant a bomb and defend it, or both to win the round. If you win a round then you get one point, to<br> 
                    win the whole game you need to gain 13 points (13 rounds). Additionally, at every start of the game you start with a certain amount<br> 
                    of currency. With this currency, players can purchase weapons, however each weapon have different value which is based on their<br> 
                    effectiveness and firepower. To earn that type of currency, users would have to win rounds and get kills, however, you can also<br> 
                    gain them, but in small amounts, through just completing rounds.
