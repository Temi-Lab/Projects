                The creation of this website, which would include the text, design, logo, etc., were made by me.<br>
                However, the images that are displayed came from <a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/VALORANT_Wiki">Valorant Wiki</a>, which I have to say was very helpful<br>
                to me. Additionally, if you would like to know more about Valorant and its specifics, then Valorant<br>
                Wiki goes a lot more in depth. However, just to clarify, I have only used their images, as they have<br>
                created individual pictures of agent that are also transparent. I would also like to thank the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PlayVALORANT">Valorant</a><br>
                Youtube channel, as the have provided me with the gameplay video.
